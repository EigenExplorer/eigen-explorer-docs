EigenExplorer APIs require a valid API key to authenticate requests. Every request (other than system health routes) must include this key to successfully access the API.

## Creating an API Key

</Frame>

1. Sign in to the [EigenExplorer Developer Dashboard](https://developer.eigenexplorer.com).
2. Generate a new API key in the API Keys section and you are good to go!

**API Key Management**: You can create up to 3 active keys at once. If you need to rotate or deactivate a key, simply delete the old key and generate a new one.

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in every request to the EigenExplorer API by adding an `x-api-token` header:

```
x-api-token: <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

For additional examples, please see our [Getting Started guide](get-started).
