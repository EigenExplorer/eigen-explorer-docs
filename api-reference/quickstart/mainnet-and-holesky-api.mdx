We support both **Ethereum Mainnet** and **Holesky Testnet** API.

The mainnet API uses the following base URL:

```
https://api.eigenexplorer.com
```

while the Holeksy testnet API uses the following base URL:

```
https://api-holesky.eigenexplorer.com
```

The API endpoints are the same for both networks, but the data returned will be different. Please make sure to use the correct base URL when making requests.

<Note>
    Please note that the sample requests and responses in this documentation are
    based on the Ethereum Mainnet API.
