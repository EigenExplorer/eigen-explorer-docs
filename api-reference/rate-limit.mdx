    Starting January 6th, 2025, API key authentication will be required. We are
    currently transitioning to mandatory API key usage.
</Warning>

Rate limits are enforced for both Ethereum Mainnet and Holesky Testnet API endpoints.

### Network-Specific Limits

Currently, the rate limits for both Ethereum Mainnet and Holesky Testnet are the same. Requests per minute (req/min) are counted separately for each network, while the monthly request allowance (req/month) is shared across both networks.

#### Ethereum Mainnet

-   10,000 Requests per Month
-   100 Requests per Minute

#### Holesky Testnet

-   100 Requests per Minute
-   10,000 Requests per Month

### Rate Limit Exceeded

If you exceed the rate limit, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
